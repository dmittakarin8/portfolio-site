## What is X Tracker?


**X Tracker** is a terminal-based tool that monitors follow/unfollow activity for selected X (Twitter) accounts in real time. It is lightweight and can run on a low-cost VPS.  The code is built for a specific RapidAPI plan and will need to be modified to accomodate a different set of API endpoints.  I also added discord/telegram notifications.

## Why I Built It

I'm a blockchain enthusiast and X is the place for "alpha".  I wanted to monitor what projects/accounts my targeted accounts were following so that I could do further research.  Many X tracking apps including X's own API are very expensive.  I needed something simple / lightweight / cheap.  I've been able to run this with no downtime on a $3/month vps with a $20/month RapidAPI plan.
